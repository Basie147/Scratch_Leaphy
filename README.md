# Manual for Digital Twin Integration with Leaphy Platform

## Introduction

This manual guides the integration of a Digital Twin (DT) into the Master Next Level Engineering (MNLE) program at the University of Applied Sciences Utrecht (HU) using the Leaphy platform, Arduino Cloud, and a dedicated Digital Twin website. The DT bridges theoretical knowledge with practical applications, equipping students with essential skills in robotics.

- Tuesday: Development of an interactive system.
- Wednesday: Data management and maintenance detection.
- Thursday: Change management and human factors.
- Friday: Evaluation and professional skills development.

## Intorduction Digital Twin (DT)
A Digital Twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that mirrors the real-world entity through continuous data exchange. It allows real-time monitoring, simulation, and analysis, enabling prediction of outcomes and optimization of operations.

## Key Components

- Leaphy Robot: The physical hardware serving as the primary subject of the DT.
- Arduino Cloud: A platform for programming and managing the Leaphy robot, allowing remote control and data collection.
- Digital Twin Website: An online interface for interacting with the digital representation of the Leaphy robot.

## Hardware




## Software

### Leaphy Easy Bloqs
Leaphy Easybloqs is a block-based programming environment designed specifically for the Leaphy educational robot. It allows users, particularly beginners and young learners, to program the Leaphy robot using a visual interface with drag-and-drop code blocks, eliminating the need to write complex syntax. The blocks represent various programming constructs and robot commands, making it easy to control the robotâ€™s movements, sensors, and other functionalities. Easybloqs simplifies the learning process, making it accessible for students to explore coding concepts. https://leaphyeasybloqs.com/

### Arduino Cloud sketches 
Allow users to write, compile, and upload code to Arduino-compatible devices directly from the cloud. It supports real-time monitoring and control of connected devices through a web interface. Users can create and manage  projects, define variables, and visualize data using customizable dashboards. The cloud environment provides access to libraries and allows easy integration with third-party services. It also offers remote updates and device management, making it convenient for deploying and maintaining projects without needing direct physical access to the hardware. https://app.arduino.cc/sketches
