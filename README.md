# Leaphy Digital Twin Main Page

## Introduction

This manual guides the integration of a Digital Twin (DT) into the Master Next Level Engineering (MNLE) program at the University of Applied Sciences Utrecht (HU) using the Leaphy platform, Arduino Cloud, and a dedicated Digital Twin website. The DT bridges theoretical knowledge with practical applications, equipping students with essential skills in robotics.

## Objectives

- **Hands-On Learning**: Practical engineering tasks.
- **Skill Development**: Understanding complex concepts through practical application.
- **Real-World Simulation**: Scenario testing and data-driven decision-making.

## Introduction to Digital Twin (DT)

A Digital Twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that mirrors the real-world entity through continuous data exchange. It allows real-time monitoring, simulation, and analysis, enabling prediction of outcomes and optimization of operations.

## Key Components

- **Leaphy Robot**: The physical hardware serving as the primary subject of the DT.
- **Arduino Cloud**: A platform for programming and managing the Leaphy robot, allowing remote control and data collection.
- **Digital Twin Website**: An online interface for interacting with the digital representation of the Leaphy robot.
