## Software

### Leaphy Easy Bloqs
Leaphy Easybloqs is a block-based programming environment designed specifically for the Leaphy educational robot. It allows users, particularly beginners and young learners, to program the Leaphy robot using a visual interface with drag-and-drop code blocks, eliminating the need to write complex syntax. The blocks represent various programming constructs and robot commands, making it easy to control the robotâ€™s movements, sensors, and other functionalities. Easybloqs simplifies the learning process, making it accessible for students to explore coding concepts. https://leaphyeasybloqs.com/

### Arduino Cloud sketches 
Allow users to write, compile, and upload code to Arduino-compatible devices directly from the cloud. It supports real-time monitoring and control of connected devices through a web interface. Users can create and manage  projects, define variables, and visualize data using customizable dashboards. The cloud environment provides access to libraries and allows easy integration with third-party services. It also offers remote updates and device management, making it convenient for deploying and maintaining projects without needing direct physical access to the hardware. https://app.arduino.cc/sketches
